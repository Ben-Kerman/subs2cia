## The Todo List
### v0.3 point release goals
 - [ ] Simple CLI to GUI wrapper
    - .app and .exe releases would be nice
 - [ ] pyPi repo publishing stuff and things
 - [ ] clean up dry-run 
 - [ ] Option to ignore certain ranges for OP/ED removal

### Bucket list 
 - [ ] Handle directories as inputs
 - [ ] make file extensions more flexible (for demuxing and outputs)
    - [ ] for mp3, add user-settable bitrate/quality options 
        (right now if it outputs to mp3, defaults to 320k CBR)
 - [ ] add more/better documentation, quick start guide
 - [ ] Skip intermediate files be default, go directly from video to condensed audio/video
    - [ ] try going to intermediate formats if direct method fails (and add a CLI switch for it as well)
 
### The neverending future
 - [ ] more testing
    - [ ] more Windows testing
